    <p><b>About Matcha</b></p>
    <p>Matcha is one of my favorite drinks because it provides a slower release of energy as compared to coffee, 
        and tastes better in my opinion! Some of my favorite matcha spots in the Bay Area in California include 
        Izumi Matcha, and Stonehill Matcha. In Boston some of my favorite matcha cafes include Cafe Matcha Maiko
        and Blank Street. Blank Street also has many different flavors of matcha such as blueberry or cinnamon, 
        which is easy to add to homemade matcha as you can get different flavored syrups. Some places where you 
        can buy your own matcha powder are at cafes such as Izumi matcha where they sell Marakoyu Koyamen and
        Ippudo powder which are ceremonial grade and high quality matcha powders. These brands tend to be more 
        expensive as they are ceremonial grade, but you could get more affordable brands such as Aiya at Whole
        Foods, or at Trader Joes where they sell their own matcha powder blend in packets. It is also really easy 
        to make matcha at home, some necessary materials include a bamboo matcha whisk, matcha powder, and water.
            Some people like to drink matcha with a simple water base, but my favorite recipes tend to be milk based
            with added syrups for flavor. One of my favorite recipes is a vanilla matcha latte recipe, which is made
            by adding vanilla syrup to the drink as detailed below.
