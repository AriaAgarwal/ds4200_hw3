    <h3>About Me!</h3>
    <p id = 'main'> Hi! My name is Aria Agarwal and I am a second year undergraduate student at
         Northeastern University studying Data Science and Biology! I was born and raised in
          California, but wanted to come to the East Coast for college and pursue this unique major. 
          I am passionate about exploring the intersections between biology, medicine and data science, 
          especially using machine learning tools to inform biomedical challenges. On campus I am part 
          of the Gyori Lab of Computational Biomedicine at Northeastern, and ViTAL which is Northeastern's
           Healthcare Innovation Core. In the lab I worked on a library for protein analysis, and I am the 
           Project Organizer for ViTAL as we are planning our first healthcare hackathon. The experiences I 
           had being on these teams made me passionate about the healthcare field, and applying the knowledge 
           I learned in class to real world challenges. Some of my hobbies include reading, drinking matcha,
            making ceramics, going to the beach, and spending time with friends and family. I also have a 
            dog named Cosmo, and I love going on walks with him as well. One topic this website will feature 
            in specific is an “All About Matcha” page, where I will talk about my favorite matcha spots in 
            Boston and California, how to make matcha at home with a recipe, and some places where you can 
            buy your own matcha powder!
